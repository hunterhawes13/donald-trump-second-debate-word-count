var text = "Well I actually agree with that I agree with everything she said I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country This is a great country A great land Ive gotten to know the people of the country over the last year and a half that Ive been doing this as a politician I cannot believe Im saying that about myself but I guess I have been a politician and my whole concept was to make America great again When I watched the Iran deal being made some horrible things like Obamacare health insurance and health care is going up with numbers that are astronomical  percent  percent when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us Its a onesided transaction Where were giving back  billion to a terrorist state really the number one terror state weve made them a strong country from really a very weak country from just three years ago When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has  we have such tremendous potential Whether its in business and trade where were doing so badly Last year we had almost  billion trade deficit Other words trading with other countries We had an  billion deficit Its hard to believe Inconceivable Were going the make great deals Haivng a strong border is going to bring back law and order Just today policeman were shot  two killed And this is happening on a weekly basis We have to bring back respect to law enforcement At the the same time we need the take care of people on both sides We need justice But I want to do things that havent been done including fixing and making innercities better for AfricanAmericans and for the Latinos Hispanics and I look forward to making America great again I dont think you understood This was locker room talk Im not proud of it I apologize to my family To the American people Certainly Im not proud of it But this is locker room talk When we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads where you have frankly drowning people in steel cages wars and horrible horrible fights all over  so many bad things happening We havent seen anything like this the carnage all over the world Can you imagine the people that are frankly doing so well against us with ISIS And they look at our country and see whats going on Yes Im very embarrassed by it I hate it But its locker room talk and its one of those things I will knock the hell out of ISIS Were going to defeat ISIS Get on to much more important things and much bigger things I have great respect for women Nobody has more respect for women than I do I said things that frankly you hear these things And I was embarrassed by it But I have tremendous respect for women No I have not I will tell you that Im going the make our country safe Were going to have borders in our country which we dont know People are pouring into our country and coming in from the Middle East and other places Were going to make America safe again Make America great again but safe again And were going to make America wealthy again because if you dont do that it just it sounds harsh to say but we have to  I would build up the wealth Other nations are taking our jobs and wealth Am I allowed to respond to that Its just words folks Just words Those words Ive been hearing them for many years I heard them when they were running for the senate In New York Where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed Ive heard them where hilly is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country which are a disaster Educationwise Jobwise Safetywise In every way possibleful Im going to help the AfricanAmericans help the Latinos hispanics I am going to help the inner cities Shes done a terrible job for the AfricanAmericans She wants their votes and does nothing and then comes back four years later We saw that firsthand when the United States senator She campaigned where the  So shes allowed to do that but Im not allowed to respond Sounds fair This tape is generating intense interest In just  hour its become the single most talked about story of the entire  cycle on Facebook with millions and millions of people discussing it on social network As we said we want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media and our first on this topic Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook Trump says the campaign has changed him When did that happen So Mr Trump let me add to that When you walked off that bus at age  were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently And you have two minutes for this That was locker room talk Im not proud of it I am a person who has great respect for people for my family for the people of this country And certainly Im not proud of it but that was something that happened If you look at Bill Clinton far worse mine are word his was action This is what he has done to women Never been anybody in history of politics in this nation thats been so abusive to women so you can say any way you want to say it but Bill Clinton was abusive to women Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously Four of them here tonight One of the women who is a wonderful woman at  yearsold was raped at  Her client she represented got him off and shes seen laughing at the girl who was raped She is here with us tonight so dont tell me about words And absolutely I apologize for those words But it is things that people say but what President Clinton did he was impeached lost his license to practice law He had to pay an  fine To one of the women Paula Jones whos also here tonight And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and talks about words that I said  years ago I think its disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth Well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign Sidney Blumenthal another real winner that you have and hes the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that So you really owe him an apology Youre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign Sent the pictures around with president Obama long before I was involved Number two Michelle Obama Ive gotten to see the commercials that they did on you And Ive gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials Ive ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you Hillary So you talk about friend go back and take a look at those commercials A race where you lost fair and square Unlike the Bernie Sanders race where you won but not fair and square in my opinion All you have to do is take a look at Wikileaks and see what they say about Sanders and see what WassermanSchultz had in mind Never had a chance I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil but when you talk about apology I think the one you should really be apologizing for and this thing you should be apologizing for are the  emails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of emails and other things last week taken from an office and are now missing Ill tell you what I didnt think Id say this and Im going to say it and hate to say it If I win Im going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because theres never been so many lies so much deception Never been anything like it and were going to have a special prosecutor When I speak I go out and speak the people of this country are furious In my opinion the people that have been longterm workers at the FBI are furious There has never been anything like this where emails and you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete  emails and then acid watch them or bleach them A very expensive process so were going to get a special prosecutor because people have been their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what youve done And its a disgrace and honestly you ought to be ashamed Because youd be in jail And yet she didnt know the word the letter C on a document Right She didnt even know what that letter meant You know its amazing Im watching Hillary go over facts And shes going after fact after fact and lying again Because she said she you know what she did  the email  was fine You think it was fine I dont think so She said that  emails had to do with her daughters wedding number one and a yoga class Right She didnt even know what that letter meant You know its amazing Im watching Hillary go over facts And shes going after fact after fact and lying again Because she said she you know what she did  the email  was fine You think it was fine I dont think so She said that  emails had to do with her daughters wedding number one and a yoga class Maybe well give three or four or five  emails deleted and now shes saying there wasnt anything wrong more importantly that was after getting the subpoena Got it from the United States Congress and Ill be honest I am so disappointed in congressmen including Republicans for allowing this to happen Our justice department  where her husband goes on to the back of a plane for  minutes talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting  emails again you should be ashamed of yourself What you did and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress Let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States government You didnt delete them  What about the other  Id like to know why arent you bringing up the emails It hasnt been finished Nice one on three No Im a gentlemen go ahead It is such a great question and maybe the question I get almost more than anything else Outside of defense Obamacare is a disaster You know it We all know it Its going up at numbers that nobodys seen worldwide Nobodys ever seen numbers like this for health care Only gets worse Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more and more money We have almost  trillion in debt Obamacare will never work Its very bad Very bad health insurance Far too expensive And not only expensive for the person that has it unbelievably expensive for our country One of the biggest line items very shortly We have to repeal it And replace it With something absolutely much less expensive And something that works Where your plan can actually be tailored We have to get rid of the lines around the state Artificial lines where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing because they want and President Obama and whoever was working on it they want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies We want competition Youll have the finest health care plan there is She wants to go to a single payer plan which would be a disaster Somewhat similar to Canada If youve noticed the Canadians when they need a big operation they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow Its catastrophic in certain ways But she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything Hillary Clinton has been after this for years Obamacare was the first step Obamacare is a total disaster and not only are your rates going up by numbers nobodys believed but your deductibles are going up so unless you get hit by a truck youre never going to be able to use it It is a disastrous plan and has to be repealed And replaced First of all Hillary everythings broken about it Everything Number two Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment This is a perfect example of it Ill tell you Youre going to have plans that are so good because were going to have some competition Once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come Youre right about Islamophobia and thats a shame One thing we have to do is we have to make sure that because there is a problem whether we like it or not  and we could be very politically correct but whether we like it or not there is a problem and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on When they see hatred going on they have to report it In San Bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed  and wounded many many people Horribly wounded Never be the same Muslims have to report the problems when they see them And you know theres always a reason for everything If they dont do that its a very difficult situation for our country because you look at Orlando And you look at San Bernardino and the World Trade Center Look at Paris The horrible these are radical islamic terrorists And she wont even mention the word and nor will President Obama He wont use the term radical Islamic terrorism Now to solve the problem you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name She wont say the name and President Obama wont say the name But the name is there Its radical Islamic terror and before you solve it you have to say the name First of all Captain Kahn is an American hero and if I were president at this time he would be alive today because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing I would not have had our people in Iraq Iraq was disaster So he would have been alive today The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting From certain areas of the world Hillary Clinton wants to allow   Why dont you interrupt her Has not been debunked  She just went about  second over her time Could I just respond to this please Hillary Clinton in terms of having people come into our country we have many criminal illegal aliens when we want to send them back to their country their country says we dont want them In some cases theyre murders and they dont want them Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state said thats okay we cant force it Let me tell you Im going to force them right back into their country Their murderers and some very bad people When Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment she has really bad judgment because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like youve never seen Were letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip and it shouldnt be allowed to happen ICE just endorsed me   just endorsed me and they endorsed me because I understand the border She doesnt She wants amnesty for everybody Come right in Come right over Its a horrible thing shes doing Shes got bad judgment And honestly so bad that she should never be president of the United States That I can tell you I think I should respond because so ridiculous Now shes blaming  she got caught in a total lie Her papers went out to everybody at the banks and she said things Wikileaks that just came out She lied Now shes blaming the lie on the late great Abraham Lincoln Thats one that I havent  okay honest Abe never lied Thats the good thing Thats the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you Thats a big big difference  were talking about some difference But as far as other elements of what she was saying I dont know Putin I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together as an example But I dont know Putin I notice anytime anything wrong happens they like to say the Russians  she doesnt know if its the Russians doing the hacking Maybe there is no hacking But they always blame Russia and the reason is because they think theyre trying to tarnish me with Russia I know about Russia but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia I have no businesses I have no loans from Russia I have a very very great balance sheet so great when I did the old post office on Pennsylvania avenue the united States government because of my balance sheet which they actually know very well chose me to do the old post office between the white house and congress chose me to do the old post office One of the primary area things perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet But I have no loans with Russia You could go to the United States government and they would probably tell you that because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have Now the facts are very simple First of all I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes Many of her friends took bigger deductions Warren Buffett took a massive deduction Soros took a massive deduction Many of the people giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials from me took massive deductions I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes about you but as soon as my routine audit is finished Ill release my returnsOne thing I would do is get rid of carried interest One of the greatest provisions for people like me I give up a lot when I run because I knock out the tax code She could have done this be years ago Shes a United States senator She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code Well why didnt she change it Why didnt you change it when you were a senator The reason you didnt is all your friends take the same advantage that I do You have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change But you wouldnt change it because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump But and I say that about a lot of things Ive heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years I wish you would have done this For  years shes been doing this stuff She never changed and she never will change Were getting rid of carried interest provisions Im lowering taxes actually because I think its so important for corporations because we have corporations leaving massive corporations and little ones little ones cant form Were getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes Were bringing the tax rate down from  percent to  percent Were cutting taxes for the middle class I will tell you we are cutting them big league for the middle class I will tell you Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes folks You can look at me Shes raising your taxes really high And what thats going to do is a disaster for the country But she is raising your taxes and Im lowering your taxes That in itself is a big difference We are going to be thriving again We have no growth in this country If China has a GDP of  percent its like a national catastrophe Were down to  percent And thats like no growth Were going lower in my opinion And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high Just about the highest in the world And Im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world And I think its so important one of the most important things we can do But she is raising everybodys taxes massivelyA lot of my writeoff was depreciation and that Hillary as a senator allowed The people that give her all this money want it I understand it the tax code better than anybody thats run for president Hillary Clinton its extremely complex Hockey has friends that want the carried interest provision which is very important to Wall Street people But they really want the carried interest provision Which I believe Hillarys leaving Very interesting why shes leaving carried interest Number one I pay tremendous numbers of taxes I absolutely used it So did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from Now I wont mention their names because theyre rich but theyre not famous We dont make them famous Of course I do So do all of her donors or most of her donors I know many of her donors They took massive tax writeoffsNo but I pay tax and pay federal tax too I have a writeoff a lot of it is depreciation Its a wonderful charge If she had a problem for  years shes been doing this Anderson I say it all the time She talks about health care Why didnt she do something about it She talks about taxes She doesnt do anything about anything other than talk With her its all talk and no action In the past  and again Bernie Sanders its really bad judgment She has made bad judgment not only on taxes shes made bad judgments on Libya on Syria On Iraq I mean her and Obama whether you like it or not the way they got out of Iraq the vacuum theyve left thats why ISIS formed in the first place They started from that little area and now theyre in  different nations Hillary Congratulations Great jobWhy didnt you do it Why didnt you do it You could have done it if you were an effective  If you were an effective senator could you have done it But you were not an effective senator  She said a lot of things that were false I think we should be allowed   Shes been a disaster as a senator ";
